# auto-street-light-control

## This mini project implements a simple streetlight control system using ESP32, FreeRTOS, Firebase, and ultrasonic sensors. It adjusts light brightness based on vehicle detection and ambient light, and alerts if a vehicle stays for unusually longâ€”indicating traffic congestion.
